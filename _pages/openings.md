## Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the AMAs Group.

We are always looking for highly motivated and talented researchers and students to join our research team. Members of the AMAs Research Group predominantly come from materials science backgrounds. Given the interdisciplinary nature of many of our research projects, we also welcome applicants with backgrounds in mechanical engineering, physics, computational materials science and mechanics, data analysis, and machine learning. We thrive on learning from each otherâ€™s diverse expertise.

For information about undergraduate, graduate, and visiting research opportunities, please send us an [email](mailto:soroush.najafiran@gmail.com).

**ðŸ“¢ We are currently open for Graduate Students and Visiting Researchers to join our research projects. The positions are mostly related to the corrosion performance and biocampatibility of Mg alloys.**

**Opening 1:** Looking for highly motivated graduate students and researchers interested in corrosion studies on Mg-Zn-Ca and Mg-Gd-Zn magnesium alloys and WE43 magnesium composites. For more information, please see [(this document)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PHD1.pdf).

**Opening 2:** Looking for highly motivated graduate students and researchers to investigate hot compression behavior and mathematical modeling of Mg-Gd-Zn magnesium alloy. For more information, please see [(this document)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/PHD2.pdf).

### Applications for PhD positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student, please send an [email](mailto:y.palizdar@merc.ac.ir) to Dr. Palizdar. In your email, briefly state why you are interested in this position and attach your CV. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ in the subject line.

### Master projects for MERC students
If you are a MSc student at MERC looking for a thesis project, contact Dr. Palizdar (or any group member) per email or stop by his office.

### Bsc/MSc students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a MSc degree in a joint student program with Iran University of Science & Technology, visit <a href="https://www.merc.ac.ir/vice-presidents/research/postgraduate" target="_blank">MERC admissions</a>.

Occasionally, when there is a perfect match and a project is suitable for a graduate student who is not admitted to MERC, there might be opportunities for a Research Assistantship (RA). We currently do not have funds for research assistantships or collaborations. However, we highly encourage researchers to apply for either a capstone project (1 semester duration) or a research project (typically 1-year duration).

We are also open to adding undergraduate students or summer interns to our team if we receive exceptional applicants. If you are interested, please read some of our papers and send us an email with your CV, transcript, and specific interests. Note that the workload might be high, but the likelihood of publications is high as well.
