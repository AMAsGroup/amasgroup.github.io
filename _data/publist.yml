  description: This study investigates the effect of adding 0.12 and 0.25 wt% vanadium to a delta-TRIP steel. Optical microscopy, SEM, hardness measurements, tensile testing, and X-ray diffraction analysis were used. The steel's structure consisted of delta-ferrite, allotriomorphic ferrite, martensite, and pearlite. The addition of 0.12 wt% vanadium enhanced the steel's mechanical properties, achieving the best combination of strength and elongation percentage. The steel with 0.12 wt% vanadium is considered third-generation advanced high-strength steel.

  description: To prepare a compact and anti-corrosion Zn-Ce LDH coating on AZ31 magnesium alloy, the various molar ratios of Zn/Ce cations, and different pH values were employed during preparation of the precursor solution. The composition, morphology, structure, and wettability of the deposited coatings were comprehensively characterized via scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the static sessile drop method. Besides, potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coatings comparatively. Also, the self-healing ability of the coating was investigated by monitoring the scratched areas of the samples immersed in 3.5% NaCl solution for a long time up to 21 d.

  description: Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) is one of the promising surface treatment methods that can enhance the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys. However, the existence of pores and microcracks significantly restricts the further advancement of corrosion resistance. In this study, effective and environmentally friendly materials, layered double hydroxides (LDH), with and without combination of rGO (reduced graphene oxide) nanosheets, were employed to seal the pores and micro-cracks in order to enhance the anti-corrosion and degradation performance of the MAO coating on AZ31. Microstructural morphologies and crystallography of the coatings were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The corrosion performances of coatings were investigated by an electrochemical workstation. Moreover, hydrophobicity and surface free energy of the synthesized coatings were measured by sessile drop method.

  image: cover_powder-tech.jpg
  description: An X-ray diffractometer, a field-emission scanning electron microscope, and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope were utilized to characterize the structural and microstructural evolutions of the AlCrNi alloy powders. The single-phase Cr (Al, Ni) nanostructured solid-solution was synthesized through the high-energy planetary ball milling in 96 h. It was turned out that the decagonal quasicrystal obtains after the annealing treatment at 1035 °C. The formation of the decagonal quasicrystalline phase in the AlCrNi alloy system was first investigated in the present article. A differential thermal analyzer was employed for the examination of the thermal performance of the AlCrNi alloy powders. The specific surface area of the mechanically alloyed and heat-treated AlCrNi alloy powders was determined through the BET analysis without any further alkali leaching. The specific surface area of the AlCrNi alloy powders containing the decagonal quasicrystalline phase possesses a high value of 1.75 m2g−1.

  image: Magnesium2021.jpg
  description: The pH values of the solution, ratios of the cations, intercalated compounds, and hydrothermal conditions are the main parameters that influenced the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) efficiency. In this paper, the composite of the Oxide/LDH coatings, containing Zn2+ and Ce3+/Ce4+ as metal cations, were prepared on the AZ31 substrate by a combined co-precipitation and hydrothermal processing method for the first time. To investigate the effect of Ce ions on the deposition of the suitable coating on AZ31, the LDHs with different ratios of the cations were synthesized. The comprehensive characterizations of the morphology, composition, structure, of the synthesized coatings, were investigated by SEM, XRD. PDP and EIS measurements were conducted to compare the corrosion behaviors of the coatings. The self-healing ability of the scratched samples was investigated. The finding of this study proves that a composite coating composed of the uniform scaffold-like clusters of the oxides incorporated with the LDH plates is successfully produced which can retard the corrosion of the AZ31 effectively.

  description: The quasicrystalline materials represent a new materials group with definite crystallite structural characteristics, in which the AlCuFe(B) quasicrystalline alloys have been widely studied owing to its various technological advantages such as easily accessible in nature, thermal stability, affordability as well as not having toxic constituent elements. Although these materials can be achieved by different procedures, the synthesis of more extensive amounts of AlCuFeB quasicrystalline single-phase powders is more complicated. In this study, the Al67Cu20Fe10B3 quasicrystalline alloys were synthesized through the mechanical alloying process and afterward consolidated to the bulk specimens by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) technique. The structural and microstructural evolutions, as well as the morphology of as-milled powders and phase transformations, were studied during the ball milling process using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and x-ray diffractometry (XRD), while the thermal behavior was investigated using differential thermal analysis (DTA).

  image: cover_material-scienceA.jpg
  description: In this study, attempts have been made to study the effects of RE on the tensile behavior of a low carbon Nb-microalloyed steel which confronts yield point phenomenon during its tensile test. The results of the tensile tests and microstructural examinations presented in this research showed that the upper and lower yield points increase by the RE addition which was mainly attributed to the indirect effects of RE on the Nb-precipitation manner and refinement of the microstructure. The results also demonstrated that the flow behavior (oscillation in stress level) during the Lüders strain zone is considerably different for the base and RE-added steels. It was found that the RE-added steel undergoes a uniform propagation of the Lüders bands while the base steel showed a distinct non-uninform Lüders strain with rough fluctuations of stress level within this area. This could be due to the uniformity in distribution of nanoprecipitates and solute, e.g. C, atoms in the RE-added steels. Moreover, It was observed that the Lüders strain increases in the presence of RE which could be probably attributed to the finer ferrite grains and the change in nanoprecipitation behavior caused by RE addition. A significant increase in total elongation of the RE-added steel was also observed.
