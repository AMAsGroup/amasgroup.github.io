  image: cover_corrosion-com.jpg
  description: To prepare a compact and anti-corrosion Zn-Ce LDH coating on AZ31 magnesium alloy, the various molar ratios of Zn/Ce cations, and different pH values were employed during preparation of the precursor solution. The composition, morphology, structure, and wettability of the deposited coatings were comprehensively characterized via scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and the static sessile drop method. Besides, potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted to evaluate the corrosion resistance of the coatings comparatively. Also, the self-healing ability of the coating was investigated by monitoring the scratched areas of the samples immersed in 3.5% NaCl solution for a long time up to 21 d.

  image: cover_surface-coating.jpg
  description: Micro-arc oxidation (MAO) is one of the promising surface treatment methods that can enhance the corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys. However, the existence of pores and microcracks significantly restricts the further advancement of corrosion resistance. In this study, effective and environmentally friendly materials, layered double hydroxides (LDH), with and without combination of rGO (reduced graphene oxide) nanosheets, were employed to seal the pores and micro-cracks in order to enhance the anti-corrosion and degradation performance of the MAO coating on AZ31. Microstructural morphologies and crystallography of the coatings were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The corrosion performances of coatings were investigated by an electrochemical workstation. Moreover, hydrophobicity and surface free energy of the synthesized coatings were measured by sessile drop method.

  description: Welding processes were accomplished by means of a 600 W Continuous Wave (CW) fiber laser instrument in bead on plate manner with 60, 80 and 100 J mm−1 heat inputs. δ-TRIP Steel samples were similar in chemical composition and only contained different Nb amounts. Elevation of heat input resulted in changes in microstructure and hardness properties, which are desirable for welders to guarantee safe joints in engineering structures.

  image: cover_powder-tech.jpg
  description: An X-ray diffractometer, a field-emission scanning electron microscope, and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope were utilized to characterize the structural and microstructural evolutions of the AlCrNi alloy powders. The single-phase Cr (Al, Ni) nanostructured solid-solution was synthesized through the high-energy planetary ball milling in 96 h. It was turned out that the decagonal quasicrystal obtains after the annealing treatment at 1035 °C. The formation of the decagonal quasicrystalline phase in the AlCrNi alloy system was first investigated in the present article. A differential thermal analyzer was employed for the examination of the thermal performance of the AlCrNi alloy powders. The specific surface area of the mechanically alloyed and heat-treated AlCrNi alloy powders was determined through the BET analysis without any further alkali leaching. The specific surface area of the AlCrNi alloy powders containing the decagonal quasicrystalline phase possesses a high value of 1.75 m2g−1.

- title: "Improvement in the Corrosion Resistance of AZ31 Magnesium Alloy Via a Composite Coating of the Zn–Ce LDH/Oxide"
  image: Magnesium2021.jpg
  description: The pH values of the solution, ratios of the cations, intercalated compounds, and hydrothermal conditions are the main parameters that influenced the layered double hydroxides (LDHs) efficiency. In this paper, the composite of the Oxide/LDH coatings, containing Zn2+ and Ce3+/Ce4+ as metal cations, were prepared on the AZ31 substrate by a combined co-precipitation and hydrothermal processing method for the first time. To investigate the effect of Ce ions on the deposition of the suitable coating on AZ31, the LDHs with different ratios of the cations were synthesized. The comprehensive characterizations of the morphology, composition, structure, of the synthesized coatings, were investigated by SEM, XRD. PDP and EIS measurements were conducted to compare the corrosion behaviors of the coatings. The self-healing ability of the scratched samples was investigated. The finding of this study proves that a composite coating composed of the uniform scaffold-like clusters of the oxides incorporated with the LDH plates is successfully produced which can retard the corrosion of the AZ31 effectively.
