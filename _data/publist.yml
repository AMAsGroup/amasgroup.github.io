  description: This study investigates the effect of adding 0.12 and 0.25 wt% vanadium to a delta-TRIP steel. Optical microscopy, SEM, hardness measurements, tensile testing, and X-ray diffraction analysis were used. The steel's structure consisted of delta-ferrite, allotriomorphic ferrite, martensite, and pearlite. The addition of 0.12 wt% vanadium enhanced the steel's mechanical properties, achieving the best combination of strength and elongation percentage. The steel with 0.12 wt% vanadium is considered third-generation advanced high-strength steel.

The addition of 10% B4C significantly improved wear resistance, particularly at higher loads. The superior wear performance of the hot-rolled WE43-10%B4Cp composite was ascribed to improved hardness and strength, as well as increased work hardening capacity of subsurface due to the presence of hard and thermally stable B4C particles with uniform dispersion and proper bonding to the matrix.

  description: Welding processes are performed using a 600 W fiber laser instrument with heat inputs of 60, 80, and 100 J mm−1. δ-TRIP Steel samples had similar chemical compositions but different Niobium amounts. Increased heat input led to changes in microstructure and hardness properties, affecting welders' ability to ensure safe joints in engineering structures. An increase in heat input reduced austenite content in weld metals, reducing hardness by 40% and 37% for 40Nb and 72Nb steels, respectively.

  description: The quasicrystalline materials represent a new materials group with definite crystallite structural characteristics, in which the AlCuFe(B) quasicrystalline alloys have been widely studied owing to its various technological advantages such as easily accessible in nature, thermal stability, affordability as well as not having toxic constituent elements. Although these materials can be achieved by different procedures, the synthesis of more extensive amounts of AlCuFeB quasicrystalline single-phase powders is more complicated. In this study, the Al67Cu20Fe10B3 quasicrystalline alloys were synthesized through the mechanical alloying process and afterward consolidated to the bulk specimens by cold isostatic pressing (CIP) technique. The structural and microstructural evolutions, as well as the morphology of as-milled powders and phase transformations, were studied during the ball milling process using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and x-ray diffractometry (XRD), while the thermal behavior was investigated using differential thermal analysis (DTA).

Results show that RE addition increases yield points due to indirect effects on Nb-precipitation and microstructure refinement. The Lüders strain zone flow behavior differs between base and RE-added steels, with RE-added steel exhibiting uniform propagation and increased Lüders strain due to finer ferrite grains and nanoprecipitation behavior. Total elongation also increases in RE-added steel.
